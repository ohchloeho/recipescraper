# RecipeScraper CLI (GO)
This is a CLI application built with Go Cobra

## Installing RecipeScraper with HomeBrew

Run ```brew tap ohchloeho/ohchloeho``` followed by ```brew install ohchloeho/ohchloeho/recipescraper```

If recipescraper has already been installed, the above commands will update the CLI application.

## Using RecipeScraper

In a terminal, type recipescraper to start the CLI application. It should prompt you for a recipe URL.

Insert any recipe URL and the output should parse the data.

## Future release notes
As this is my first CLI application build in Golang, I am intending to extend its functionalities where users are able to save recipes to markdown files.
